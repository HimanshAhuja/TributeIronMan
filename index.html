        <p>Iron Man is definitely the coolest superhero. His suit of armor is so fascinating. I also like Iron Man
            because he proved that a human could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with demigods and super soldiers. With just
            his intellect, ingenuity and a couple million bucks, Iron Man is a self-made hero.
